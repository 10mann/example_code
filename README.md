This is a repository including an old assignment.

The assignment was to write a program that stores students with id, name and email. It would also keep track of the courses the students took and what test and scores the students got. 

It is a simple while loop that iterates until the user inputs "10" and the program exits.

Student, test and testResults are classes that are added to lists of the same class type.


This assignment involves the use of classes, input/output, operator overloading, lambda functions, the algorithm library, iterators and pointers.
